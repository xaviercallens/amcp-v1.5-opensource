## 🎯 Feature Summary

Implement **AMCP v1.5** with enhanced developer experience, CloudEvents 1.0 compliance, and production-ready implementation classes. This major release focuses on simplifying agent development while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## 🚀 Motivation

### Developer Pain Points (v1.4)
- **Verbose event publishing**: Requires 5-7 lines of boilerplate code
- **Manual event formatting**: No standardized event structure
- **Limited convenience methods**: Developers must implement common patterns repeatedly
- **Incomplete implementation**: Missing runtime classes for production use
- **Multi-language barriers**: Event format not standardized for cross-language communication

### Business Drivers
- **Faster development cycles**: Reduce time-to-market for agent-based applications
- **Standards compliance**: Align with CloudEvents specification for ecosystem interoperability
- **Production readiness**: Provide complete implementation for enterprise deployment
- **Multi-language ecosystem**: Prepare foundation for Python, Rust, C# SDKs

## 📋 Detailed Requirements

### 1. CloudEvents 1.0 Specification Compliance
- [ ] **Event class enhancement** with CloudEvents field mapping
  - `messageId` → CloudEvents `id`
  - `topic` → CloudEvents `type`
  - `timestamp` → CloudEvents `time`
  - `sender` → CloudEvents `source`
  - `payload` → CloudEvents `data`
- [ ] **Content type support** with `dataContentType` and `dataSchema` fields
- [ ] **Compliance validation** methods: `isCloudEventsCompliant()`, `validateCloudEventsCompliance()`
- [ ] **CloudEvents format export**: `toCloudEventsMap()` for external integration
- [ ] **AMCP extensions** preserved with `amcp` prefix in CloudEvents format

### 2. Simplified Agent API with Convenience Methods
- [ ] **Direct messaging**: `sendMessage(AgentID targetAgentId, String messageType, Object payload)`
- [ ] **Broadcasting**: `broadcastEvent(String eventType, Object payload)`
- [ ] **Content-aware publishing**:
  - `publishJsonEvent(String topic, Object payload)`
  - `publishTextEvent(String topic, String payload)`
  - `publishCloudEvent(String topic, Object payload, String contentType)`
- [ ] **Smart subscriptions**:
  - `subscribeToAgent(AgentID sourceAgentId, String eventPattern)`
  - `subscribeToBroadcasts(String eventType)`
  - `subscribeToAllBroadcasts()`
- [ ] **Enhanced publishing**: `publishEventAndWait(String topic, Object payload)`

### 3. Enhanced Lifecycle Management
- [ ] **Error handling**: `onError(Event event, Throwable error)` callback
- [ ] **Event processing**: `onEventProcessed(Event event)` for metrics
- [ ] **State management**: `onStateChange(AgentLifecycle previous, AgentLifecycle new)`
- [ ] **Health monitoring**: `isHealthy()` with custom validation support
- [ ] **Structured logging**: `logInfo()`, `logWarn()`, `logError()` with agent context

### 4. Complete Runtime Implementation
- [ ] **SimpleAgentContext** - Full `AgentContext` implementation
  - Agent lifecycle management (create, activate, deactivate, destroy)
  - Event routing and subscription management
  - Inter-agent communication support
- [ ] **SimpleAgent** - Enhanced base agent class
  - All convenience methods implemented
  - Built-in error handling patterns
  - Extensible for custom agent logic
- [ ] **InMemoryEventBroker** - Production event broker
  - Full `EventBroker` interface implementation
  - Topic pattern matching with wildcards
  - Thread-safe pub/sub functionality

## 🎮 Acceptance Criteria
